# About

The Spirit Island Builder is a fan-made and unofficial tool for creating custom Spirit Island content. It is a passion project for me, Resonant, with contributions and support from a number of different individuals to whom I'm incredibly grateful. The Builder was built as an interface to an older tool called "the template", to which I also contributed before envisioning a website version.

My goal with this project is to lower the barrier to entry for aspiring homebrew game designers. I hope it makes custom content creation faster, more exciting, and more rewarding.

Thank you to:
- Neubee for translating my vision to a website
- Tom & Derrick for development support, particularly on solving some tricky features such as image export
- The folks who worked on the Spirit Island Template, including Gudradain, LokiMidgard, LordMotas, and everyone else who contributed.
- The custom Spirit Island content communities on Discord, Reddit, and Board Game Geek forums.

If you create and share content using this tool, please link to the Builder in your post. 

And thank you for using this tool! I love hearing from users. Please feel free to provide feedback via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/7EaVLHfAvhmLjEDn8) or by emailing me directly at resonant@spiritislandbuilder.com
